                  <p>College of Science Recognition Day for school year 2010-2011 was carried out on March 22, 2011 at the Bulwagang Balagtas, Ninoy Aquino Library Resource Learning Center of the main campus of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines. The said program was headed by the Dean of the CS, Dr. Zenaida R. Sarmiento; and Dr. Evelyn M. Machete of the Department of Physical Sciences, Dr. Lourdes V. Alvarez of the Department of Biology, Prof. Bernadeth Nobles of Mathematics and Statistics, with the participation of the science faculty. </p>

                  <p>During the event, Mr. Jeffrey C. De Vero, a research associate of the University of the Philippines Diliman Photonics Research Laboratory and also a member of CS Faculty gave an inspirational talk. He shared some of his experiences when he was a Physics student of the college and delivered motivating messages. Mr. De Vero's talk as followed by the awarding of the students who achieved academic excellence and shown good performances and leadership. This included giving of special awards to those who won the university and inter-university academic contests, graduating scholars, presidents of the college students organization, best these writers, and those who gained the highest general average. Special awards for faculty were also given to the advisers and co-advisers of student's organizations, thesis advisers and thesis panelist.</p>

                  <p>Fun is always a by-product of Physics. Either from the stressful touch of exams or the storm rage of problem sets, it is a commencement to laugh and have fun for every small thing. But the roll-going activities of the Physics Society never evade its members. For their convenience and enjoyment, the society proceeds to its once-a-year event called "Physics Funday". </p>

                  <p>Our day to day activities are affected by weather. Weather is variable both in time and space. Knowing this fact, weather forecasting deals with many uncertainties. The main question is how uncertain is the weather forecasting?</p>
                  <p>In terms of science, when you deal with variables you deal with many assumptions and limitations. Physical parame- ters as well as known physical laws are not enough to make these uncertainties negligible. Meteorology is the science that deals with the study of the atmosphere at which the weather is dependent.</p>

                  <p>Advancement in technology in the past decades allowed us to explore not only the magnificent lifeforms here on Earth but also the depth and immensity of the Universe ( at least partly ). Who among us would not be amazed of the picturesque views of planet atmosphere such as those of Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, or even our Earth seen on print materials or videos? Awesome, indeed! But the natural processes behind those huge forms are even mind-boggling yet worth working on to fully understand the mechanism involved. </p>

                  <p>In the literature, it is agreed upon that convection plays a major role in the atmosphere of a planet. Convection is a well-known physical process that pertains to fluid motions caused by temperature differences. It is essential as breathing; and, as a mode of energy transfer, it is really important in disturbing minerals and nutri- ents from the underneath to the Earth’s surface, be it on land or ocean. In addition to wind currents in the atmosphere, con- vection can also be observed during a vol- canic eruption. Molten rocks from the Earth’s inner core act as the convecting fluid that rises to the earth’s layer. The pressure beneath the earth keeps accumu- lating and the temperature constantly rises. In due time, once a critical parameter is reached, say the threshold to which the Earth can no longer hold the pressure from the inner layer, our planet will instantly collapse and then annihilate from the solar system. That is far more destructive than a volcanic eruption.</p>
